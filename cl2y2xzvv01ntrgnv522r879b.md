## Are you confused about which database architecture to use between SQL and NoSQL? Here is how Presear Softwares can help you!

When it comes to making decisions regarding the correct database architecture, the process might need prior knowledge of the database architectures.

Though the terms Relational Database Management Systems (RDBMS) and the Structured Query Language (SQL) refer to the old traditional database systems, they can be restrictive of unstructured data and hard to expand at times. While modern database systems referred to as NoSQL can be seen as raising alternatives for a variety of modern-age cases. Thus popular among young employees 

### What are SQL AND NoSQL database architectures?

SQL is a relational database that uses an ACID model with SQL syntax to structure the unstructured data. This type of architecture is useful when one doesn't want to make multiple big changes but instead requires simple modifications like cut, delete, modify, etc in a large database. This simplicity causes problems with big unstructured data or one with a lot of modifications due to its storage size.
SQL requires a high storage size, which eats up one's RAM while providing very few features in it. It uses vertical upgrading of hardware with a strict schema, making it hard to modify or relate when used in modern cases seniors sometimes use a foreign key.

These problems might not be there in NoSQL.

NoSQL is a Non - Relational Database that is best used to solve modern-day data availability problems. Its less storage, and high-performance feature with features to work with unstructured data in a flexible schema makes it popular among new employees. Though it can be used to make multiple big queries for very large data, it is not found to be good with complex queries. One may use it when they need fast data instead of a correct one.

### Usage of NoSQL and SQL according to your requirements

SQL is old and contrasting but is universally tested to act as an interface for data analysis and are tabled-based database. NoSQL is new with flexibility but they lack maturity and are document-based, key-value pairs, and graph databases that require user specialization. So which one should YOU use and when?
 
*You use NoSQL when you want* -
- To handle a huge volume of structured, semi-structured, and unstructured data.
- Where there is a need to follow modern software development practices or for fast applications.
- Have local transactions that needn't be very durable and need easy scalability with availability 
- When efficient, scale-out architecture in place of an expensive and monolithic architecture.

*You use SQL when you want* -
- To perform complex and dynamic querying and reporting.
- Keep track of financial transactions 
- Run time flexibility in your application.
- Consistency is a must and there won't be any large-scale changes in terms of data volume.

Like 2 sides of the coin, SQL and NoSQL prove to be best in their unique ways.  Your company's requirements, volume, variety of data, and preferences play a major role in deciding between the traditional database architecture and the modern one.

Some examples of SQL databases include PostgreSQL, MySQL, Oracle and Microsoft SQL Server. NoSQL database examples include Redis, RavenDB Cassandra, MongoDB, BigTable, HBase, Neo4j and CouchDB. 

### How Presear softwares can help with SQL and NoSQL databases?
The entire cloud architecture of Presear Softwares is set up with the help of Digitalocean which provides both SQL and NoSQL databases at scale.

PostgreSQL is an open-source, object-relational database built with a focus on extensibility, data integrity, and speed. Its concurrency support makes it fully ACID compliant, and it supports dynamic loading and catalogue-driven operations to let users customize its data types, functions, and more.

The features of PostgreSQL include,
- Easy Setup 
- Highly Scalable
- Free daily backups
- Automated failover
- Fast, reliable performance
- End-to-end security

For NoSQL, Redis and MongoDB are the two best choices,

Redis is an open-source, key-value database built with an in-memory design that emphasizes speed. It has support for rich data types, atomic operations, and Lua scripting. MongoDB is a source-available cross-platform document-oriented database program. Classified as a NoSQL database program, MongoDB uses JSON-like documents with optional schemas. 

Other than these, Presear Softwares also has access to several other database products from Amazon Web Services(AWS) and their integrations like Oracle SQL, Microsoft SQL Server, AuroraDB, DocumentDB, Amazon Neptune and Amazon Timestream.

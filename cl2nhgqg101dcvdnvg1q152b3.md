## The FUMER way to empower Frontend application UI using react, the ultimate Frontend beast In the industry

Front-end Development is one constantly blooming environment, and new development tools keep emerging on the frontline every day.This Blog contains  **F= Functional**, **U= Usable**, **M= Maintainable**, **E= Efficient**, **R= Reliable** methods for Creating Fast, Modular, Simple, and Scalable Frontend Interfaces for a Better User Experience.

Frontend UI applications made with the help of react are simple,speedy and scalable.React uses component-based architecture for developing applications. Components are independent and reusable bits of code. These components can be shared across various applications having similar functionality. The re-use of components increases the pace of development. 

React uses the concept of virtual DOM which ensures the UI updates quickly and efficiently.Each time the data changes in a react app, a new virtual DOM gets created. Creating a virtual DOM is much faster than rendering the UI inside the browser. A dashboard or data-visualization screen needs continuous updates of components so that you can track your data in real-time. For instance, non-stop updates of data-charts and notifications need to be displayed on the screen immediately and effectively. Reacts Virtual DOM allows you to implement some smart workarounds that ensure the fast re-rendering of components, which is necessary since the data needs to be displayed immediately and effectively. In such situations, React will figure out an optimal way to update the UI, and all you have to do is to supply the stream of data through API. It helps in building even complex dashboards that require heavy data lifting.

React gives the benefit of SPA to a social networking App.This helps in making more functional and scalable UI.While a dynamic social network website loads a new page in response to every user request, only a part of your SPA will change when a user clicks any button. Thus, if a user likes the activity, only the ‘heart’ symbol will get highlighted without refreshing the entire page. This approach will save additional “client-to-server” requests, improving the application performance.

React made the Web application more SEO friendly.React allows developers to develop engaging user interfaces that can be easily navigated in various search engines. With React, you have the liberty to use server-side-rendering. By using React SSR, the information can be rendered from the webpage on the server, and not on your browser using Javascript. Since the initial render is done from the server, the subsequent pages will load directly from the client. 

React follows unidirectional data binding or data flow.The data is passed from the parent component to child component through read-only props. These props cannot be sent back to the parent component. This is how one-way data binding works. Although, the child component can communicate with the parent component to update the state via callback functions.

State management in React gives immense performance benefits for eCommerce.While building a web app like eCommerce, the chances are that your application has to look after a variety of things, such as what items are in stock or what item a user has added to his wishlist. Any actions that require instant action or a change in the state of the component will need to have some sort of state. 

Reactjs is an excellent addition to the projects that need component reusability, impressive user interactions, or crazy animations. That said, it’s a robust UI library to build projects that cater to small, medium, and even large-scale organizations.
